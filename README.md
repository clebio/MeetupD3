# Visualizations of Meetup.com via D3

This Django application is an exercise in using [D3 layouts][1]. We leverage the [Meetup.com API][2] to gather information about events and members and then display them in possibly intresting or useful ways.

This is a full re-write of the initial investigation begun in my [d3talk repo][3].

##Implementation
Your Meetup API key goes in `apiKey.txt` and is excluded from versioning via `.gitignore`.
